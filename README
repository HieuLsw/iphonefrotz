iPhoneFrotz version 0.6

iPhone port of Frotz by Craig Smith <csmith@austin.rr.com>, based on Frotz v2.43
by David Griffith, Jim Dunleavy, Galen Hazelwood, and Stefan Jokisch .

Thanks to the authors of NES.app and Mobile Terminal.app for providing example code, bits
of which have made their way into this project (Keyboard show/hide anim and FileBrowser).

The iPhone version supports Z-Machine versions 3 - 8, excluding version 6 (graphics support
ala Zork Zero).  Timed input is also not yet supported.

Build using 'make iphone'.
Copy Frotz.app to your iPhone's /Applications directory and reboot your iPhone.
Copy Z-machine data files (.z3, .z5, .dat, etc.) to /var/root/Library/Frotz/Games.

Please see the README and AUTHORS files in the doc directory for more information
about this source, and the history of interactive fiction and Infocom.

0.2
 - Move story and save file location to /var/root/Media/Frotz instead of Library/Frotz
   for easier access by iPhuc, etc.
 - Detects if the old Library location exists but the Media location doesn't at startup
   and moves the files automatically.
 - Auto-create the Saves directory so the autosave feature works correctly if the user
   hasn't manually made the directory.
