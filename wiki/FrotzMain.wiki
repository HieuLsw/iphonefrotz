*Version 1.3 Pending* 

07/21/2009

I submitted a new version of Frotz to the App Store for approval on June 18.  It's been over 5 weeks in limbo now and I haven't heard anything back from Apple.   It's extremely frustrating, so much so I am considering abandoning the App Store and moving Frotz to jailbroken iPhones.

Assuming it's eventually approved by Apple, 1.3 will include:

 * New Story Font Size option: change the main story font size from 8 to 16 point font
 * Status Line magnification:  tap anywhere on the status line to magnify it for readability.   (Because many games expect a minimum number of screen columns, supporting larger status line fonts requires scrolling left and right, which is awkward and cumbersome, but magnification seems to solve the problem.)
 * Command Line History: double tap on the command line to bring up a menu of recently enter command
 * Common Words Menu: Triple tap on the command line to bring up a menu of common words.  (This is an initial implementation and I plan to add a compass rose and improve the UI in the future.)
 * Bug fixes for iPhone OS 3.0, restoring the ability to tap to scroll and show/hide the keyboard

*New Version 1.2 Available* 

04/15/2009 

My apologies for the long hiatus in development.  A new version of Frotz is now available on the App Store.  Changes include:

 * More performance improvements:  Frotz manages story metadata better and uses less memory.
 * Support for transferring both story files and saved games using a built-in FTP server
 * Preferences allowing you to select custom text and background colors and change the story font
 * Ability to disable automatic word completion, useful for playing games in languages than English
 * Fixed bugs handling fixed-width text in story output

----

*New Version 1.0.1 Available* 

8/27/2008

A new version of Frotz is now available on the App Store.  Changes include:

 * Performance improvements:  Frotz no longer slows down during long sessions, and uses less memory. 
 * Miscellaneous bug fixes and interface improvements.
 * Added help for users new to Interactive Fiction. 
 * Support for deleting bundled games from Story List.
 * Support for transferring games with MobileFinder.

Color/font settings did not make it into this version, but will be available shortly.  Well, as shortly as possible given Apple's week long turn around for approval.


= Interactive Fiction at Your Fingertips =

Frotz lets you play hundreds of free works of Interactive Fiction (a.k.a. text adventure games) on your iPhone or iPod Touch.  

Frotz plays games written in the Z-Machine format.  This format was invented by Infocom and was used to produce great text adventures from the 80s such as the Zork Trilogy, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Trinity.

In the past decade, text adventures have experienced a renaissance thanks to a great Internet community of interactive fiction writers and fans.  Many of these games are written using the same engine that powered Infocom's titles, thanks to the Inform compiler and authoring system created by Graham Nelson.

Frotz includes several built-in games, and includes a web portal for downloading new ones from the Internet.
