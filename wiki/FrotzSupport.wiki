#summary Frotz Support

A new version of Frotz (1.0.1) is now available on the App Store. 
[http://code.google.com/p/iphonefrotz/wiki/FrotzMain Click here] for details.

This page contains frequently asked questions and miscellaneous help about using Frotz for the iPhone/iPod Touch.

----

*To report a bug or usability issue with Frotz on iPhone or iPod Touch, please click [http://code.google.com/p/iphonefrotz/issues/entry here], or go to the Issues tab, click "New Issue", and describe your problem.*   (Note that this requires you to sign in to GMail.  If you do not have a GMail account, you can also report a bug by emailing ifrotz at gee mail dot com.)

----
  * *What device/OS versions is Frotz compatible with?*
   
   Frotz works on iPod or iPod Touch with OS versions 2.0 and later.   (1.4 users can use the older 'jailbroken' version via Installer.app, but that is no longer maintained.)  One user has reported performance issues running Frotz using firmware 2.0.1 on an iPod Touch.  The problem has not been reported on the iPhone, and I have not seen it myself, but it's probably a good idea to update to the latest OS version (currently 2.0.2).

  * *What happened to title "Frotz" in the navigation bar in 1.0.1?*

  This is a cosmetic bug which showed up at the last minute only in the optimized release build.  Once submitted for approval, an app can't be modified, and it takes Apple almost a week to approve the app, so I just had to let it go.  The whole process is very frustrating for developers.

  * *Why is Frotz free?*

  Frotz would be worth nothing without the wealth of great games created by the talented writers and game designers in the IF (Interactive Fiction) community.  I've gotten a lot of enjoyment playing these games over the years, and since I'm not a very good writer, this is my way of giving back.

  * *Can I make a donation?*

  See above for my motivation in making Frotz.   But if you really like Frotz and want to make a donation, you can do so via [https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=craig%40ni%2ecom&item_name=Frotz%20for%20iPhone%2fiPod%20Touch&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8 PayPal].   (Also consider sending thank you emails to the authors of the games you like!)

  * *How do I save my game?*
  A review of Frotz on iTunes incorrectly states that there is no way to save state in games. 
  If you press the Home button or answer a call, Frotz will automatically save your game state, but to save your game in progress and start a new one, you actually do it the old-fashioned way.

  Just type "*`save`*" at the game's prompt to save your game, and "*`restore`*" to load a previously saved game.  This is mentioned on the _(i)_nfo page, but perhaps needs to be made more salient for people without old-school experience playing text adventures.

  * *How do I delete games?*
  When you're not playing a story, the standard Edit button in the top right can be used to go into 'delete' mode.  When a story is active, this is replaced by "Now Playing", but you can still use the swipe gesture to delete a story.  

  * *How can I transfer my own story files (e.g. Infocom files) so Frotz can find them?*

  If you have the Lost Treasures of Infocom, other Infocom game files from antiquity, or your own personal Z-Machine game files, you can use them with Frotz.
    *  If you have [http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=286746714&mt=8 MobileFinder] (Mac or PC) or [http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284797161&mt=8 File Magnet] (currently Mac only), just use it to transfer your story files to your device.   (You may put them in a subfolder if you want.)  Frotz will automatically display such files in the list of playable stories. Frotz does not copy the files, so you need to keep them in MobileFinder or File Magnet to continue to play them.
       *Warning - Apple has deliberately broken this in OS 2.1.  This only works if you are still running 2.0.x.)*

    * Otherwise, you can access your files using the built-in web interface:
      * You will need access to a public web server, or set up your own temporary local web server.  You can also use a free file hosting site such as zshare.net.
      * In Frotz, go to "Browse IFDB", select the Search icon at the bottom, and type in the URL of your web server.
      * Frotz will download and install if you click on any link ending in .z3, .z4, .z5, .z8, .dat, or .zblorb.
      * Frotz can also handle ZIP downloads.  If you click on a ZIP file, Frotz will download it, extract files with the playable extensions and add them to the story list, and then delete the ZIP file.
    * Support for DataCase has been abandoned because it requires help from its developers and they haven't responded to queries.

  * *Performance*
  The performance problems in Frotz 1.0 have been fixed in 1.0.1.  If you notice very poor performance, please file a new bug report.  Please do not just file a negative review on iTunes without also filing a bug report so I can have an opportunity to reproduce and fix it.
