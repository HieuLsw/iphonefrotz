  * *"I can't believe this is free"* -- a review on iTunes

  I briefly thought about charging 99 cents, but Frotz would be worth nothing without the great games created by the  wealth of talented writers in the Internet Interactive Fiction (IF) community, and I have no way of giving them their cut.   However, since it did cost me $99 to get the license to publish the app, if you want to donate to offset that cost, I wouldn't mind.   You can do so via PayPal [https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=craig%40ni%2ecom&item_name=Frotz%20for%20iPhone%2fiPod%20Touch&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8 here].

  * *Saving Games*
  A recent review of Frotz on iTunes incorrectly states that there is no way to save state in games. 
  If you press the Home button or answer a call, Frotz will automatically save your game state, but to save your game in progress and start a new one, you actually do it the old-fashioned way.

  Just type "*`save`*" at the game's prompt to save your game, and "*`restore`*" to load a previously saved game.  This is mentioned on the _(i)_nfo page, but perhaps needs to be made more salient for people without experience playing the old school text adventures.

  * *Transferring your own story files (e.g. Infocom files)*

  If you have the Lost Treasures of Infocom, other Infocom game files from antiquity, or your own personal Z-Machine game files, you can use them with Frotz.
    * If you have File Magnet (currently Mac only), just use it to transfer your story file to your device.  Frotz will automatically display it in the list of Story Files.
    * Otherwise, you can access your files using the built-in web interface:
      * You will need access to a web server, or set up your own temporary web server
      * In Frotz, go to "Browse IFDB", select the Search icon at the bottom, and type in the URL of your web server.
      * From will download and install if you click on any link ending in .z3, .z4, .z5, .z8, .dat, or .zblorb.
    * Support for DataCase (Mac and PC) is planned.
