#summary Frotz Support

This page contains frequently asked questions and miscellaneous help about using Frotz for the iPhone/iPod Touch.

Frotz Version 1.3  for iPhone / iPod Touch is finally available (!) on the App Store as of 2009-09-19, three months and 1 day after being originally submitted for approval.

New features in Frotz 1.3:
 * Story Font Size preference: allows you to vary the main story font size from 8 to 16 point.
 * Status Line magnification: tap anywhere on the status line to magnify it for readability. (This is in lieu of allowing larger status line fonts, because many games require a minimum number of screen columns, which would force you to scroll left and right to see the entire line.)
 * Command Helper Menu: tap on the command prompt to bring up a helper menu of common words.
 * Command Line History: double-tap on the command line to bring up a menu of recently entered commands.
 * Accessibility Improvements: improved accessibility hints for VoiceOver users. Selecting the story window will recite only the story output since the most recent command.
 * Bug fixes (OS 3.0): restored the ability to tap on the story output to scroll one page, or show the keyboard if at the end.
 * Bundled stories: includes a large subset of well-rated stories from the IFDB bundled with Frotz; the IFDB story browser uses these bundled files instead of downloading them from the Internet.

To obtain compliance with App Store policy, the newly submitted version no longer has Internet download capability. Instead, it now has all Z-code games rated 3 stars or more from the Interactive Fiction Database pre-bundled with Frotz; the user experience of browsing IFDB to select and add games is still the same unless you try to pick an unbundled game. Not included with Frotz are games which are low-rated, in a language other than English, newer than the IFDB snapshot taken on 9/1/2009, or games not in IFDB at all.

Note that the Frotz FTP server is still available; only the ability to download from the Internet directly from within Frotz has been disabled.  Local LAN transfer is still okay, and any previously installed games will still be there after you upgrade.

  * *Why isn't Frotz free anymore?   Will it be again?*
    * *Update 9/19/09* - As promised, since 1.3 has finally been approved, I just set the price to be free; it will take effect overnight.   My goal in making Frotz for iPhone is to promote IF to as wide an audience as possible, not to make money.  (I have a day job that does me just fine for that.)  The temporary $0.99 price for the past few weeks was to make back iTunes Dev Program fees and provide an incentive for me to put up with Apple's painful and arbitrary review process.

  * *Why isn't Frotz free anymore?   Will it be again?*

   When I signed up to the iPhone Dev program, it was my understanding that the $99 fee was a one time thing.  Turns out it's not; it's an annual fee.  And Apple and its approval process has been so frustrating to deal with that I really feel like giving up on the whole thing.    I just can't help resenting having to pay Apple a hundred bucks a year just to maintain a free app that adds value to the App Store when they treat the developers so badly.  For now, I've decided to charge $0.99 (or local 'tier 1' equivalent) for a little bit so I can earn back the money I've given Apple to be able to put up Frotz in the App Store.  After that, I'll make it free again.  If you just want to try it out and would rather not pay, just wait a couple weeks and it'll be free again.  On the other hand, if you already downloaded Frotz while it was free and want to contribute something, you can *[https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=craig%40ni%2ecom&item_name=Frotz%20for%20iPhone%2fiPod%20Touch&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8 donate via PayPal]*.
    * *Update 9/4/09* I plan on making Frotz free again as soon as Apple approves the newly submitted update.

  * *How can I transfer my own story files (e.g. Infocom files) so Frotz can find them?*

  If you have the Lost Treasures of Infocom, other Infocom game files from antiquity, or your own personal Z-Machine game files, you can use them with Frotz.
     * Frotz 1.2 now includes a built-in FTP (file transfer protocol) server, so you can easily transfer your own story files, as well as saved games, from pretty much any computer.   To enable the FTP server, press the (i)nfo button in Frotz,  select the "File Transfer" button, and follow the instructions.  Note that you must be connected to a wireless network to use file transfer; it will not work over Edge or 3G.
     * Note that Frotz will not look for stories in ZIP files if you transfer them with FTP; you should transfer the files individually and make sure they end in a standard suffix such as .z5 or .zblorb.
     * If you have your files on a web server, you can access them using the built-in web interface:
       * In Frotz, go to "Browse IFDB", select the Search icon at the bottom, and type in the URL of your web server.
       * Frotz will download and install if you click on any link ending in .z3, .z4, .z5, .z8, .dat, or .zblorb.
       * You cannot download saved games this way; use the FTP server instead.
       * Frotz can also handle ZIP downloads.  If you click on a ZIP file, Frotz will download it, extract files with the playable extensions and add them to the story list, and then delete the ZIP file.  Again, this doesn't work with FTP, but I plan to add that in a future version.

  * *What device/OS versions is Frotz compatible with?*
   
   Frotz works on iPhone or iPod Touch with OS versions 2.0 and later.

  Frotz would be worth nothing without the wealth of great games created by the talented writers and game designers in the IF (Interactive Fiction) community.  I've gotten a lot of enjoyment playing these games over the years, and since I'm not a very good writer, this is my way of giving back.

 * *Can I make a donation?*

  See above for my motivation in making Frotz.   But if you really like Frotz and want to make a donation, you can do so via [https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=craig%40ni%2ecom&item_name=Frotz%20for%20iPhone%2fiPod%20Touch&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8 PayPal].   (Also consider sending thank you emails to the authors of the games you like!)

  * *How do I save my game?*
  A review of Frotz on iTunes incorrectly states that there is no way to save state in games. 
  If you press the Home button or answer a call, Frotz will automatically save your game state, but to save your game in progress and start a new one, you actually do it the old-fashioned way.

  Just type "*`save`*" at the game's prompt to save your game, and "*`restore`*" to load a previously saved game.  This is mentioned on the _(i)_nfo page, but perhaps needs to be made more salient for people without old-school experience playing text adventures.

  * *How do I delete games?*
  When you're not playing a story, the standard Edit button in the top right can be used to go into 'delete' mode.  When a story is active, this is replaced by "Now Playing", but you can still use the swipe gesture to delete a story.  

  * *Performance*
  The performance problems in Frotz 1.0 were fixed in 1.0.1, and further improved in 1.2.  If you notice very poor performance, please file a new bug report.  Please do not just file a negative review on iTunes without also filing a bug report so I can have an opportunity to reproduce and fix it.
