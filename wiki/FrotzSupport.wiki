#summary Frotz Support

Frotz Version 1.2  for iPhone / iPod Touch is currently available on the App Store. 

Version 1.3, with font size options and command line history, has been resubmitted to the App Store as of Sept. 4, 2009 after being previously rejected.  The point of contention was Frotz's ability to download new games from the Internet, as downloading interpreted content is disallowed by the rules.

To obtain compliance, the newly submitted version no longer has download capability.  Instead, it now has all Z-machine games rated 3 stars or more from the IFDB pre-bundled with Frotz; the user experience of browsing IFDB to select and add games is still the same unless you try to pick an unbundled game.  Not included with Frotz are games which are low-rated, in a language other than English, newer than the IFDB snapshot taken on 9/1/2009, or games not in IFDB at all.

This page contains frequently asked questions and miscellaneous help about using Frotz for the iPhone/iPod Touch.

  * *Why isn't Frotz free anymore?   Will it be again?*

   When I signed up to the iPhone Dev program, it was my understanding that the $99 fee was a one time thing.  Turns out it's not; it's an annual fee.  And Apple and its approval process has been so frustrating to deal with that I really feel like giving up on the whole thing.    I just can't help resenting having to pay Apple a hundred bucks a year just to maintain a free app that adds value to the App Store when they treat the developers so badly.  For now, I've decided to charge $0.99 (or local 'tier 1' equivalent) for a little bit so I can earn back the money I've given Apple to be able to put up Frotz in the App Store.  After that, I'll make it free again.  If you just want to try it out and would rather not pay, just wait a couple weeks and it'll be free again.  On the other hand, if you already downloaded Frotz while it was free and want to contribute something, you can *[https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=craig%40ni%2ecom&item_name=Frotz%20for%20iPhone%2fiPod%20Touch&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8 donate via PayPal]*.

  * *How can I transfer my own story files (e.g. Infocom files) so Frotz can find them?*

  If you have the Lost Treasures of Infocom, other Infocom game files from antiquity, or your own personal Z-Machine game files, you can use them with Frotz.
     * Frotz 1.2 now includes a built-in FTP (file transfer protocol) server, so you can easily transfer your own story files, as well as saved games, from pretty much any computer.   To enable the FTP server, press the (i)nfo button in Frotz,  select the "File Transfer" button, and follow the instructions.  Note that you must be connected to a wireless network to use file transfer; it will not work over Edge or 3G.
     * Note that Frotz will not look for stories in ZIP files if you transfer them with FTP; you should transfer the files individually and make sure they end in a standard suffix such as .z5 or .zblorb.
     * If you have your files on a web server, you can access them using the built-in web interface:
       * In Frotz, go to "Browse IFDB", select the Search icon at the bottom, and type in the URL of your web server.
       * Frotz will download and install if you click on any link ending in .z3, .z4, .z5, .z8, .dat, or .zblorb.
       * You cannot download saved games this way; use the FTP server instead.
       * Frotz can also handle ZIP downloads.  If you click on a ZIP file, Frotz will download it, extract files with the playable extensions and add them to the story list, and then delete the ZIP file.  Again, this doesn't work with FTP, but I plan to add that in a future version.

  * *What device/OS versions is Frotz compatible with?*
   
   Frotz works on iPhone or iPod Touch with OS versions 2.0 and later. 

<wiki:comment>
  Frotz would be worth nothing without the wealth of great games created by the talented writers and game designers in the IF (Interactive Fiction) community.  I've gotten a lot of enjoyment playing these games over the years, and since I'm not a very good writer, this is my way of giving back.

 * *Can I make a donation?*

  See above for my motivation in making Frotz.   But if you really like Frotz and want to make a donation, you can do so via [https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=craig%40ni%2ecom&item_name=Frotz%20for%20iPhone%2fiPod%20Touch&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8 PayPal].   (Also consider sending thank you emails to the authors of the games you like!)

  * *How do I save my game?*
  A review of Frotz on iTunes incorrectly states that there is no way to save state in games. 
  If you press the Home button or answer a call, Frotz will automatically save your game state, but to save your game in progress and start a new one, you actually do it the old-fashioned way.

  Just type "*`save`*" at the game's prompt to save your game, and "*`restore`*" to load a previously saved game.  This is mentioned on the _(i)_nfo page, but perhaps needs to be made more salient for people without old-school experience playing text adventures.

  * *How do I delete games?*
  When you're not playing a story, the standard Edit button in the top right can be used to go into 'delete' mode.  When a story is active, this is replaced by "Now Playing", but you can still use the swipe gesture to delete a story.  

  * *Performance*
  The performance problems in Frotz 1.0 were fixed in 1.0.1, and further improved in 1.2.  If you notice very poor performance, please file a new bug report.  Please do not just file a negative review on iTunes without also filing a bug report so I can have an opportunity to reproduce and fix it.
