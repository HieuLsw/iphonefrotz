  * *Why is Frotz free?*

  Frotz would be worth nothing without the wealth of great games created by the talented writers and game designers in the IF (Interactive Fiction) community.  I've gotten a lot of enjoyment playing these games over the years, and since I'm not a very good writer, this is my way of giving back.    (Since I had to pay Apple $99 to publish applications, though,  I'm not above accepting donations.  If you'd like to donate, you can do so via [https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=craig%40ni%2ecom&item_name=Frotz%20for%20iPhone%2fiPod%20Touch&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8 PayPal].)

  * *Saving Games*
  A recent review of Frotz on iTunes incorrectly states that there is no way to save state in games. 
  If you press the Home button or answer a call, Frotz will automatically save your game state, but to save your game in progress and start a new one, you actually do it the old-fashioned way.

  Just type "*`save`*" at the game's prompt to save your game, and "*`restore`*" to load a previously saved game.  This is mentioned on the _(i)_nfo page, but perhaps needs to be made more salient for people without experience playing the old school text adventures.

  * *Deleting Games*
  When you're not playing a story, the standard Edit button in the top right can be used to go into 'delete' mode.  When a story is active, this is replaced by "Now Playing", but you can still use the swipe gesture to delete a story.  You can currently only delete stories you downloaded yourself; the bundled stories are impervious to deletion because iTunes installs them read-only, but a way to hide them will be added in an update.

  * *Transferring your own story files (e.g. Infocom files)*

  If you have the Lost Treasures of Infocom, other Infocom game files from antiquity, or your own personal Z-Machine game files, you can use them with Frotz.
    * If you have File Magnet (currently Mac only), just use it to transfer your story file to your device.  Frotz will automatically display it in the list of Story Files.
    * Otherwise, you can access your files using the built-in web interface:
      * You will need access to a public web server, or set up your own temporary local web server.  You can also use a free file hosting site such as zshare.net.
      * In Frotz, go to "Browse IFDB", select the Search icon at the bottom, and type in the URL of your web server.
      * From will download and install if you click on any link ending in .z3, .z4, .z5, .z8, .dat, or .zblorb.
    * Support for DataCase (Mac and PC) is planned.

  * *Sluggish Performance*
  Frotz can start to slow down the longer you play a game.  This is primarily because the iPhone has trouble keeping up when the length of the text in the story view area becomes too big.   I'll be working on improving this for the next version, but in the mean time, you can speed things up just by getting the game to clear the screen.
    # Try using "help", supported by most games, then 'Q' to quit help and return to the game.  Going into the help system will clear the story area, and improve performance.
    # If the game you're playing doesn't have help, then do "save" to save your game, then "quit", restart your game, and "restore".   Restarting will clear the screen, and restoring via the command prompt will not redisplay text from the previous session.
