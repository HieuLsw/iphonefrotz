  * *Saving Games*
  A recent review of Frotz on iTunes incorrectly states that there is no way to save state in games. 
  If you press the Home button or answer a call, Frotz will automatically save your game state, but to save your game in progress and start a new one, you actually do it the old-fashioned way.

  Just type "*`save`*" at the game's prompt to save your game, and "*`restore`*" to load a previously saved game.  This is mentioned on the _(i)_nfo page, but perhaps needs to be made more salient for people without experience playing the old school text adventures.

  * *Transferring your own story files (e.g. Infocom files)*

  If you have the Lost Treasures of Infocom, other Infocom game files from antiquity, or your own personal Z-Machine game files, you can use them with Frotz.
    * If you have File Magnet (currently Mac only), just use it to transfer your story file to your device.  Frotz will automatically display it in the list of Story Files.
    * Otherwise, you can access your files using the built-in web interface:
      * You will need access to a web server, or set up your own temporary web server
      * In Frotz, go to "Browse IFDB", select the Search icon at the bottom, and type in the URL of your web server.
      * From will download and install if you click on any link ending in .z3, .z4, .z5, .z8, .dat, or .zblorb.
    * Support for DataCase (Mac and PC) is planned.
